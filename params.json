{"name":"Novation-launchcontrol-xl-bitwig","tagline":"A controller script to get the Novation LaunchControl XL to integrate smoothly with Bitwig Studio.","body":"Welcome. This page describes how you can get your Novation LaunchControl XL device working with Bitwig Studio.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThe novation launchpad is an awesome Midi controller. It has a plenty of good quality knobs and faders, decent capabilities in terms of led feedback and 16 mappable Midi channel... enough for a lot of different layouts and an almost-hands-off-the-keyboard-and-mouse Bitwig experience. Until then, it was just missing a good, exhaustive mapping for Bitwig Studio. Here's one. It has been designed to work better with the Novation Launchpad (in other words, it doesn't implement features to Launch clips, play notes and sequence drums. I assumed you had another device for that :) ) but please, feel free to use any controller combination you like the most.\r\n\r\nIn short, this mapping will provide you with 8 User boards on which you'll be able to assign any control in Bitwig (buttons included) as you like (it is, of course, possible to have the 8 user boards mapped to different sets of controls) and 4 factory boards (at least one more is coming from me, feel free to extend my script and add new boards with new features), suited to different use-cases (composing, jamming, playing live...). All of the factory boards can be put into \"device mode\", which will provide you total control over any selected device. It's a great mode to shape your sound or assign macros to every instrument so that you can later tweak them using the Macro board.\r\n\r\nThe mappings behind all of these board is detailed below, as well as instructions on how to install this controller script. Have fun !\r\n\r\n### How do I install the mapping ?\r\n\r\nBitwig actually provides instructions to install controller scripts here : https://www.bitwig.com/en/community/control_scripts/installation_guide .
